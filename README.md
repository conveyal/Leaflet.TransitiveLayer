## Running the Demo

This branch contains a basic demo of Leaflet.TransitiveLayer using a sample Transitive data set.

To deploy locally:

```
npm install
make
```
  
The first line installs [Component](https://github.com/componentjs/component) (may require root access on some systems); the second uses Component to download the Transitive.js dependency and build the example. Then open index.html in a web browser.
